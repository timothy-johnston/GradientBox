## Use Case 1: Gradient Surprise!
Who doesn't like surprises? When you click the "Surprise Me" or "Click for a new surprise gradient" buttons, GradientBox will randomly select a gradient from our database filled with custom-made gradients submitted by other users. There are plenty to go around - keep clicking until you find one that turly speaks to you!

## Use Case 2: Pay it Forward
You can click the "I want to create my own" button for a chance to put your creative muscles to work and contribute to the collection of GradientBox masterpieces to be shared with others. Use the color wheels to create that perfect blend of colors. Don't forget to give your gradient a fitting name! When the share button is clicked, the gradient will be added to the database to be shared with those who click the "Surprise Me" button.

In both use cases, the gradient CSS is automatically generated for easy copy-pasting.
